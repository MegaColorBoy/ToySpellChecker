#Toy Spellchecker
Inspired by Peter Norvig's article about [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). His implementation was on Python and honestly, I don't think it can get any better than his because it's so elegant and simple to understand.

However, my version is intended to take inspiration from Norvig's and exercise my C++ skills a bit lol.

Have fun reading the code :)!
